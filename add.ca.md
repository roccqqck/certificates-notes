+ click "Export..." and save it as .crt file

# Centos
+ Copy the .crt file to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` on your CentOS machine
+ run `update-ca-trust extract`
+ test it with `wget https://thewebsite.org`

# debian ubuntu
On debian and ubuntu the directory is `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and the command to update is `update-ca-certificates`

At least on ubuntu:  
Be sure that the filename ends with `.crt` and that its content starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and ends with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` and make sure you have "root CA" & "intermediate" in the same .crt file



 # if it is not working , Edit the ```CAfile``` or add crt file to ```CApath```
```
curl -v https://google.com
